# Vercel Assessment Project
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

It has been extended to render Markdown content (the assessment answers) and secured with Basic Authentication using Edge Middleware.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

ðŸ”‘ Authentication

This project is protected with Basic Access Authentication using Next.js Edge Middleware.

Environment Variables

Set the credentials in your .env.local file:

```
BASIC_AUTH_USER=assessment_user
BASIC_AUTH_PASS=choose-a-strong-password
```

Also configure them in Vercel â†’ Project Settings â†’ Environment Variables (Production + Preview).

Behavior

Visiting the site prompts for credentials.

Correct username:password â†’ allows access.

Incorrect creds â†’ returns 401 Unauthorized with WWW-Authenticate header (browser re-prompts).

Middleware excludes static assets (/_next/static, favicon.ico, etc.) from auth checks.
